Hi! My name is Yuanyuan Zhao, studying for my master degree of Data Science (Computer Science and Technology) in Academy for Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, Peking University.

I have been a research assistant in the [Language Computing and Web Mining Group](http://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/lcwm/) since 2017, supervised by [Dr. Weiwei Sun](http://wsun106.github.io).

My research focuses on deep representations for natural language and Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL).

I am looking for an institute to continue my research as a phd candidate in 2021.
If you have any advise, please contact me (zhao_yy@pku.edu.cn)!
