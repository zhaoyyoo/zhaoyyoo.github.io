Hi! My name is Yuanyuan Zhao, studying for my master degree of Data Science (Computer Science and Technology) in Academy for Advanced Interdisceplinary Studies, Peking University.

I have been a research assistant in the Language Computing and Web Mining Group (http://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/lcwm/) since 2017, supervised by Dr. Weiwei Sun (http://wsun106.github.io).

My research focuses on deep representations for natural language and Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL).

I am looking for an institute to continue my research as a doctor candidate in 2020.
If you have any advise, please contact me (zhao_yy@pku.edu.cn)!
